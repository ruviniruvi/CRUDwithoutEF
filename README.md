CRUD Application without using Entity Framework in ASP.NET Core MVC

In this C# project,I implemented CRUD operations using SQL server using stored procedures without entity framework. 
For the database connection I connected to the SQL Server using ADO.NET and all of the CRUD operations were implemented with the help of stored procedure.
